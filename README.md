# phase-audibility

Inspired by [this discussion](http://www.silcom.com/~aludwig/Phase_audibility.htm)
I have been investigating the extent to which the human auditory system is sensitive 
to changes in the relative phase of harmonic components of sound.

The first study involved a short sound clip with three piano notes: [piano](piano)

The secod study (still ongoing, May 2022) involves various vocalisations produced 
by killer whales: [orca](orca).
