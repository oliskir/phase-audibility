# Second study of phase audibility

In my second study of phase audibility I am using SRKW call examples.

The [notebook](notebook) folder contains a Jupyter notebook outlining the main ideas in a tutorial style.

The [experiments](experiments) folder contains results from two experiments 
in which human analysts were tasked with listening to phase-modified call samples.
