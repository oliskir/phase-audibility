# Second study of phase audibility

In my second study of phase audibility I am using SRKW call examples.

The folder [AR-exp-20220216](AR-exp-20220216) contains the results of an 
experiment involving a human analyst listening to phase-modified S19 calls created
with the [create_exp_s19.py] script using as input the call samples in 
[s19_examples](s19_examples) (which originate from the HALLO project).

The folder [JK-exp-20220311](JK-exp-20220311) contains the results of an experiment involving a (different) 
human analyst listening to variety of phase-modified SRKW calls created
with the [create_exp_catalog.py] script, using as input the call samples 
in [orcasound_call_catalog](orcasound_call_catalog) (which originate from 
the [Ford-Osborne catalog](https://www.orcasound.net/FordOsborneVocabulary/_SouthernVocabularyTable.html)).
